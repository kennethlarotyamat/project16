Introduction
This project aims to bring together your knowledge on the use of localhost and basic web security tactics.
Business Context
There are many ways to add forms to websites that vary according to context and platform. Nevertheless, your ability to build a basic form in HTML and improve its security using JavaScript will serve you well no matter which context you ultimately develop in.

Instructions
Begin with the Newsletter sign up form developed locally in Day 2, Lesson 1 Defending against XSS.
Add a phone number field to your Newsletter Signup form.
Use maxlength attribute to further restrict user inputs.
Create a JavaScript function to retrieve the phone number input from the user.
Check that the phone number input is not blank.
Check that the phone number contains only numbers and dashes.
If there are any issues with the phone number field, prepare an error message for the user.
If there are no problems with the phone number input, sanitize it before submitting the form.
Submission steps:
Before you click on "Mark as Completed":
You need to do one of the following: either upload all of your files to Codio or deploy a GitHub Page for this project.
Also, if you mark this project as complete but any of the boxes are blank, your TA will be unable to grade your project.
Codio upload:
Make sure all of your project code has been uploaded to Codio.
If you did not write your code in Codio, you will need to import all of the required files into your workspace file tree.
You can do this by going to File => Upload Files, and either manually importing each file, or dragging and dropping your project folder.
Please refer to this video if you are unsure of what to do.
GitHub Pages:
If you would rather upload your project to GitHub, please make sure to have the project deployed as a GitHub page so we can thoroughly test it.
If you are unsure of how to do this, please follow these instructions.
It is important to understand you will need to make a separate repository for every project. You cannot deploy multiple pages from the same repository, even with different branches.
Also, no matter whether you uploaded your files from your computer or not, make sure to thoroughly test your code! This only takes a few minutes, but will prevent the amount of resubmissions because you missed something.
GitHub Repo & Pages
If your project is uploaded to Codio, simply type "N/A".
