This is an older project, but I think that I figured out something about how 
to set up project 8 in GitHub, but I'm not sure if this will work.


This is the place where 
I will work and upload project 16

By the end of this project you will:
Restrict user inputs
Validate user inputs
Sanitize user inputs
Include a file using a relative path
Introduction
This project aims to bring together your knowledge on the use of localhost and basic web security tactics.
Business Context
There are many ways to add forms to websites that vary according to context and platform. Nevertheless, your ability to build a basic form in HTML and improve its security using JavaScript will serve you well no matter which context you ultimately develop in.

Instructions
Begin with the Newsletter sign up form developed locally in Day 2, Lesson 1 Defending against XSS.
Add a phone number field to your Newsletter Signup form.
Use maxlength attribute to further restrict user inputs.
Create a JavaScript function to retrieve the phone number input from the user.
Check that the phone number input is not blank.
Check that the phone number contains only numbers and dashes.
If there are any issues with the phone number field, prepare an error message for the user.
If there are no problems with the phone number input, sanitize it before submitting the form.
Submission steps:
Before you click on "Mark as Completed":
You need to do one of the following: either upload all of your files to Codio or deploy a GitHub Page for this project.
Also, if you mark this project as complete but any of the boxes are blank, your TA will be unable to grade your project.
Codio upload:
Make sure all of your project code has been uploaded to Codio.
If you did not write your code in Codio, you will need to import all of the required files into your workspace file tree.
You can do this by going to File => Upload Files, and either manually importing each file, or dragging and dropping your project folder.
Please refer to this video if you are unsure of what to do.
GitHub Pages:
If you would rather upload your project to GitHub, please make sure to have the project deployed as a GitHub page so we can thoroughly test it.
If you are unsure of how to do this, please follow these instructions.
It is important to understand you will need to make a separate repository for every project. You cannot deploy multiple pages from the same repository, even with different branches.
Also, no matter whether you uploaded your files from your computer or not, make sure to thoroughly test your code! This only takes a few minutes, but will prevent the amount of resubmissions because you missed something.
GitHub Repo & Pages
If your project is uploaded to Codio, simply type "N/A".

1. Project: Algo Practice & Add to Personal Website
Overview

For Project 13, you will get a little bit of practice tackling coding questions, 
upload the code for your attempts to GitHub, and also add to your website‚Äôs project session!


Step One


Complete the following:

Sign up for free accounts on 
LeetCode, [done]
Hackerrank, and [done]
CodeWars [done]

Create a GitHub repository [done]

with 3 folders (one for each of the above platforms), 
LeetCode, [x]
Hackerrank, and [x]
CodeWars [x]


and a brief README file [x]

with at least 2 sentences describing your repo [x]

[ i really don't want to create a new repository]

[https://kennethlarotyamat.github.io/miscellaneous/]

[I will continue working on this project directly in the above repository as of 10/26/2023 09:47 PM]

Work on 2 - 3 beginner level challenges from any of the above platforms (or one from each!)

Push all of your code to the GitHub repo you created

Submit a link to your repo and, if it‚Äôs a private repo, add your TA as a collaborator

NOTE: Try your best to solve the coding challenges, using comments to describe the thought 
process behind your approach. You can also ask your TA for help with these. But even if you 
can‚Äôt arrive at a solution that‚Äôs okay! The only requirement for these challenges, in terms 
of this project submission, is that it‚Äôs evident that you employed critical thinking and attempted a solution.

Step Two

Add the calculator mini project (from Lesson 1.3), or another project you completed 
outside of class, to the projects section of your website. The styling is up to you, but 
you should include a screenshot, a title, a brief description, and a link to the code on GitHub. 
Finally, submit the GitHub link below (again, if it‚Äôs a private repo, be sure to add your TA as a collaborator).

1. SEO Score Checker
SEO Score Checker
Goals:
Understanding SEO score checker: definition and function
Outline factors affecting the website‚Äôs SEO score
Use score checker to analyze website performance: identify areas for improvement
Prioritize improvement actions as a function of impact on SEO score
Realize the importance of generating a report of recommendations effectively
Grasp the difference between mobile and desktop reports as well as the importance of optimization for both

Introduction
cover image
SEO Score Checker is a tool used to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of a website‚Äôs search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. The tool analyzes various factors related to a website‚Äôs SEO, such as its content, keywords, meta tags, and backlinks. This tool also provides a score that reflects the website‚Äôs overall SEO performance.
Understanding SEO Score
An SEO Score is a numerical representation of a website‚Äôs SEO quality, calculated by evaluating various SEO factors. A high SEO score indicates that the website is well optimized for search engines and is likely to rank well in search results. A low score, on the other hand, indicates that the website needs improvement in its SEO efforts.
Steps to understanding SEO scores:
Familiarize yourself with the basics of search engine optimization (SEO): Before you can understand an SEO score, it‚Äôs important to have a basic understanding of what SEO is and what it entails. Read up on the various on-page and off-page factors that can impact a website‚Äôs search engine performance. You can even run your own website or a website of your choice through the following SEO checker: https://www.seobility.net/en/seocheck/
Choose an SEO score checker: There are many SEO score checkers available online, and each one may have a slightly different approach to calculating scores. Choose one that you feel comfortable using and that provides the information you need. Here‚Äôs a couple options to choose from:
Google Pagespeed Insights: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
GTMetrix: https://gtmetrix.com/
SEObility: https://www.seobility.net/en/seocheck/
SEO Site Checkup: https://seositecheckup.com/
Neil Patels‚Äô SEO Analyzer: https://neilpatel.com/seo-analyzer/
Enter your website‚Äôs URL: Once you‚Äôve chosen an SEO score checker, enter the URL of the website you want to analyze. The score checker will then analyze various elements of the website and provide you with an SEO score.
Interpret the SEO score: SEO scores are usually represented as a percentage or a numerical value on a scale (e.g., 1-100). The higher the score, the better the website‚Äôs SEO performance. Keep in mind that different score checkers may use different scales, so it‚Äôs important to understand how your chosen checker calculates scores.
Analyze the report: In addition to the SEO score, the score checker will likely provide a report detailing various on-page and off-page factors that are impacting the website‚Äôs performance. Read through this report carefully and make note of any areas where the website can improve.
Implement recommended changes: Based on the report, implement any changes that are recommended by the score checker. This might include optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, and header tags, improving content quality, or building more high-quality backlinks.
Repeat the process: Once you‚Äôve made the recommended changes, re-run the analysis in a few weeks to see how your SEO score has changed. Continuously monitor and improve your website‚Äôs SEO performance to stay ahead of your competition.
By following these steps, you should have a good understanding of your website‚Äôs SEO score and what you can do to improve it. Remember that SEO is an ongoing process, so be prepared to continuously monitor and improve your website‚Äôs performance.
SEO Factors
Many factors can impact a website‚Äôs search engine optimization (SEO) performance, and they can be broadly categorized into on-page factors and off-page factors.
On-page factors refer to elements that are within a website‚Äôs control and include:
Content quality and relevance: The quality and relevance of the website‚Äôs content for its target audience.
Keyword usage: The strategic use of keywords (target search terms) in titles, meta descriptions, header tags, and throughout the website‚Äôs content.
User experience: The overall user experience of the website, including website speed, mobile responsiveness, and ease of navigation.
Meta tags: The use of title tags and meta descriptions to accurately describe the website‚Äôs content and entice users to click through from the search results.
Off-page factors refer to elements that are outside of a website‚Äôs control and include:
Backlinks: The quantity and quality of links from other websites to the website in question.
Social signals: The presence and activity of the website on social media platforms.
Domain authority: The overall authority and credibility of the website‚Äôs domain.
Brand reputation: The overall reputation of the website‚Äôs brand.
These are some of the most important SEO factors, but it‚Äôs worth noting that search engines like Google are constantly updating their algorithms and what they consider to be important, so it‚Äôs important to stay up-to-date on best practices for SEO. Here‚Äôs one of the best resources to stay up to date: https://www.searchenginejournal.com/.

2. Importance of SEO Score Checker
Importance of SEO Score Checker
seo cover image
SEO score checkers are an important tool for website owners and marketers because they provide valuable insights into the website‚Äôs search engine optimization (SEO) performance. Here are some of the reasons why SEO score checkers are important:
Identifying areas for improvement: SEO score checkers provide a comprehensive analysis of the website‚Äôs on-page and off-page factors, including keyword usage, content quality, backlinks, and user experience. This information can help website owners identify areas where they can make improvements to boost their SEO performance.
Measuring progress: SEO is an ongoing process, and website owners need to continuously monitor and improve their performance to stay ahead of the competition. SEO score checkers allow website owners to track their progress over time, see how changes to their website have affected their SEO score, and adjust their strategy accordingly.
Comparing performance to competitors: Many SEO score checkers also provide competitor analysis, allowing website owners to compare their performance to that of their competitors. This information can help website owners understand how they stack up against their competition and identify opportunities for improvement.
Making data-driven decisions: SEO can be complex, and it can be difficult to know where to focus your efforts. SEO score checkers provide a comprehensive analysis of the website‚Äôs performance, allowing website owners to make data-driven decisions about where to focus their efforts for maximum impact. Here‚Äôs an example for Amazon from the Moz tool that you can try yourself: https://moz.com/competitive-research
amazon moz tool
Streamlining the optimization process: Finally, SEO score checkers can help streamline the optimization process by providing step-by-step instructions for implementing recommended changes. This can save website owners time and effort and help ensure that they are making the right changes to boost their SEO performance. Here‚Äôs an example from GTMetrix for amazon.ca
GTMetrix for amazon.ca
How to Use an SEO Score Checker
Using an SEO Score Checker is simple and straightforward. Simply enter the URL of the website that you want to check into the tool, and the tool will analyze various factors related to the website‚Äôs SEO and provide a score. Some SEO Score Checkers also provide additional information and suggestions for improvement.
One popular SEO checker is SEObility ( https://www.seobility.net/en/seocheck/ ).
Exercise: Pick one of your favorite websites and input the URL in the SEObility box. List 3 SEO improvements your selected website should make.

We will use https://apple.com/ for this example.
Here is a screenshot of SEObility‚Äôs site audit feature, which analyzes various on-page SEO elements and provides recommendations for improvement:
apple.com seo checker
SEO score checkers like SEObility typically provide a variety of information and suggestions for improvement, including:
Website Crawling and Indexing: Seobility checks if a website is crawlable and indexable by search engines like Google and provides suggestions to improve the website‚Äôs crawlability and indexability.
On-Page Optimization: Seobility analyzes the content of a website and provides suggestions for optimizing the page title, meta description, heading tags, and other on-page elements for better visibility in search engine results.
Technical SEO: Seobility checks technical SEO aspects such as website speed, mobile-friendliness, and schema markup, and provides suggestions to improve these aspects for better SEO performance.

Keyword Analysis: Seobility analyzes the keywords used on a website and provides suggestions for optimizing the content for relevant and high-traffic keywords.
In addition to providing this information, SEO checkers often include step-by-step instructions for implementing recommended changes, making it easier for website owners to improve their search engine optimization.
In general, SEO checkers analyze various elements of a website to assess its performance in search engines. These elements may include on-page factors like title tags, meta descriptions, header tags, and content quality, as well as off-page factors like backlinks and social media signals. The goal is to identify any issues that could be hurting the site‚Äôs visibility in search results and provide recommendations for improvement.
