JOSÈ DE ESPRONCEDA.


In the introductory part of this work, while acknowledging the merits
of the earlier poets of Spain, it may be remembered that a claim was
made in favour of the still superior excellences of their successors
in the present day. If the reader, who has followed us so far through
these notices, has not already come to the same conclusion, his assent
may be confidently expected to the assertion, in consideration of the
surpassingly poetical genius of the two writers who have now to come
under his review.

In considering the merits of their earlier poets, the best critics of
Spain have not been so blinded by national partiality as to be led into
awarding them unqualified commendations. In the very able prologue to
the ‘Moro Esposito’ of the Duke de Rivas, said to have been written
by the celebrated Alcalà Galiano, we find an estimation of them which
we can adopt, as correct in judgement as it is unexceptionable for an
authority. He says, “Though the tenderness of Garcilasso, the warmth
of Herrera, the fancy, at once lively and thoughtful, of Rioja, and,
above all, those strong feelings of devotion which give to Fray Luis de
Leon a character so original, even when he is most an imitator, are
sources of great perfections, and most glorious crowns of the Spanish
Parnassus, yet we are obliged to confess, that in the Spanish poets,
lyric and pastoral, we see too great a sameness, that their stock of
ideas and images is limited and common to them all, and that if varied
and choice in expression, they are uniform in their arguments and
plans, founding their merit more in the gala and pomp of language,
in the floridness and sonorousness of verse, and in the ingenious
dexterity of making variations on one theme, than in the vigour and
originality of their thoughts, or in the strength and profoundness of
the emotions which they felt, or which their works excite in the minds
of their readers.”

Entirely coinciding in the opinions thus expressed, we feel, on the
other hand, with regard to the modern Spanish poets, that while they
have fully maintained the grace and beauty that distinguished their
predecessors in former ages, their genius has expanded over far wider
fields, and embraced subjects of as varied and powerful interest as
the contemporary poetry of any other country can present to delight
or captivate. As instances in support of this opinion, we have, in
particular, to refer to the comparatively few but exceedingly brilliant
compositions of Espronceda, whose early loss, at only thirty-two years
of age, the whole literary world has to deplore.

We have great cause to be thankful to Ferrer del Rio that we have any
account at all of this very eminent lyric poet, though the one he has
given is far from being so full as the admirers of his genius might
have desired. From that account, we learn that it was in the spring
of 1810, during the most momentous period of the war of independence,
a colonel of cavalry, after some long and harassing marches, was
obliged to halt at the small town of Almendralejo, in the province of
Estremadura, in the face of the enemy, on account of his wife, who had
followed him through the campaigns, having there had a son born, the
subject of this narrative. We have no other particulars of his earlier
years, than that on the conclusion of the war his parents settled at
Madrid, where he was placed at an early age under the tuition of Lista,
a writer who enjoyed considerable reputation at the time as a poet,
but whose chief merit consisted in his critical and elementary works.
Under such a preceptor, his natural genius found a congenial course
of tuition, and verse-making seems to have been a part of his usual
studies. It was remarked, that though he was by no means inclined to
steady application, yet, that by the force of his quick comprehension,
he shone as prominently as others of greater industry, and when a mere
boy produced verses which gave tokens of future eminence.

When only fourteen years of age he joined a society of youths who
called themselves Numantines, and was elected one of their tribunes.
In their meetings, no doubt, there was much intended treason debated,
for which, whether deservedly or not, the government of the day thought
proper to proceed against them at law, and Espronceda, with others, was
sentenced to three months’ imprisonment in the convent of Guadalajera,
in which town his father then resided. There, in the solitude of his
imprisonment, his active mind found employment in poetry, and he was
bold enough to begin an epic poem on the subject of the national
hero, Pelayo. Of this poem there are fragments given among his works,
from which we may judge favourably of what it might have proved
when completed, containing as it does many striking passages. The
representation of Hunger, and the Dream of the King, Don Roderic, are
bold conceptions, and if they were not the additions of after-years,
were truly remarkable as the productions of any one at so early an age.

On his release from the convent he returned to Madrid, but feeling
himself under restraint as subject to the observation of the police,
and desirous also of visiting other countries, he shortly afterwards
went to Gibraltar and thence to Lisbon. There he seems to have been
subjected to great privations, which, however, did not prevent his
being involved in romantic adventures, characteristic of one of his
temperament, such as he subsequently described with all the warmth
of poetic feeling. But the ministers of the king, now restored to
absolute power by French intervention, could not allow Spanish
emigrants to be congregated so near to Spain, and at their instance
Espronceda and others were obliged to go from Lisbon to London. How
he maintained himself, during these wanderings, we are not informed,
but his relatives probably had the means to afford him sufficient for
his pressing necessities, and the love of adventure would lead him,
oftentimes willingly, into situations from which most others would have
recoiled.

In London, we are informed, that he enjoyed the happiest period of
his life, though not abounding in resources; passing his time between
his studies and gaieties, which resulted in confirmed dissipation.
He learned to read Shakespeare and Milton, as well as Byron, and
considering his inclinations, his habits and his writings, we need
not be surprised to find him supposed to have taken the last for his
model. There he began the series of compositions which place him in
the first rank of lyric poets, though we have to lament that they are
tinctured with a spirit of such evil character. His ‘Elegy to Spain,’
dated London, 1829, is in the original written with peculiar sweetness
of expression, which Del Rio finds in the style of the Prophet of the
Lamentations, and which, though not so well suited for translation
as most of his other poems, has been chosen as the effusion of the
patriotic muse of Spain, no less worthy of note than others of more
general application.

From London he passed over to Paris, and happening to be there during
the three memorable days of July 1830, he took part in the fearful
scenes which then took place with all the ardour of his character as
well as of youth. He joined afterwards the small band of emigrants who
crossed the Pyrenees in the hopeless attempt of subverting the despotic
sway that then prevailed, resulting in the death of Don Joaquin de
Pablo, whom his friends regarded as falling heroically, and to whose
memory Espronceda has left a poem of great beauty. Returning to Paris,
he entered himself in the rank of the bold spirits who volunteered to
lend their aid in the regeneration of Poland, from which, and other
similar schemes, he was rescued by the promulgation of the first
amnesty, of which he took advantage immediately to return to Spain.

On his arrival in Madrid, he entered himself in the Royal Guard, where
he soon won the goodwill and affections of his officers and comrades,
and might have risen to distinction, but for an unfortunate though
characteristic occurrence. He had written some verses on passing events
connected with the service, which were recited at a banquet, and having
been much applauded and passed from hand to hand, came to the knowledge
of the ministry, who thereupon, notwithstanding the efforts of his
colonel to the contrary, dismissed Espronceda from the corps, and
banished him to the town of Cuellar. There he composed a work, which he
called a novel, under the title of the ‘Sancho of Saldania,’ but which,
though containing some good sketches and descriptions, is only worthy
of notice as having been one of his compositions.

“On the dawning of liberty in Spain with the promulgation of the
Estatuto,” by Martinez de la Rosa, he came forward as a journalist,
connected with the paper published as ‘The Age.’ His proud spirit
could not submit to the censorship previously existing, but even now
he had to feel its influence. The fourteenth number of his paper, the
most violent of the time, was found to contain some articles which
were forbidden by the censor, and as the time pressed, the editors did
not know how to supply the deficiency. The ready genius of Espronceda
suggested a scheme, which, after a little hesitation, was adopted: this
was to publish the sheet in blank, with merely the headings, which
had not been struck out of the manuscript by the censor. Accordingly,
the usual sheet appeared with the titles only of the subjects it had
originally to bear, namely--“The Amnesty;” “Domestic Policy;” “Letter
from Don Miguel and Don Manuel Bravedeed in defence of their honour
and patriotism;” “On the Cortes;” “Song on the Death of Don Joaquin
de Pablo.” The effect was startling, and perhaps more powerful than
the forbidden articles would have proved. The people supplied the
deficiencies according to their individual feelings, and the ingenuity
of the device had its fullest success. As the result, the publication
of the paper was forbidden, and the managers had to hide themselves for
a time to escape further prosecution.

In the years 1835 and 1836, there were several serious commotions in
Madrid in which he joined, erecting barricades in the principal square,
and making violent harangues to the people. On both occasions the
disturbances were soon put down by the military, and he had to hide
himself in the provinces, until, in the year 1840, Espartero having
put himself at the head of the liberal party, the public principles
prevailed for which Espronceda had so exerted himself. He then
came forth again from his retirement, and made himself conspicuous
by appearing as an advocate in a case in which a paper named the
‘Hurricane’ had been denounced at law for a seditious article it
contained. Espronceda’s speech in defence, from some passages of
it given by Del Rio, appears to have been very energetic, and as
inflammatory as the article accused, but he was successful, and the
proprietor of the paper was acquitted.

In the same year, 1840, he published the volume of poems on which
his fame rests, as perhaps the first lyric poet that Spain has
produced. Most of the contents had been previously given in the
periodical publications of Madrid, but it was a great service to
literature to have them collected. They contained the fragment of
the epic poem, ‘Pelayo,’ and a short dramatic piece, entitled, ‘The
Student of Salamanca,’ in which his own character is supposed to have
been depicted; as well as the lyric odes and other poems. They are
comparatively few in number, not exceeding fifteen altogether, but of
such rare excellence as to make us regret that so gifted a writer was
to be so soon cut off, depriving the literary world of the hopes of
still further excellence they gave reason to expect. In the following
year, 1841, he published his poem, ‘The Devil World, El Diablo Mundo,’
in four cantos, to which three others were afterwards added, found
among his papers after his death. His friends had long feared that he
was not destined to attain a prolonged period of life, but their fears
were unhappily realized much sooner than they had imagined.

In December 1841, Espronceda was sent to the Hague as Secretary of
Legation, but the coldness of the climate affecting too severely his
enfeebled constitution, he was obliged, almost immediately, to return
to Spain. He had meanwhile been elected Deputy to the Cortes for
Almeria, and he attempted to take accordingly his share of public
duties. But his health and strength had been undermined by the life of
hazard, of privations and excesses he had undergone, and the journey to
the Hague in the depth of winter seemed to give the final shock to his
frame, from which it could not recover. On the 23rd of May, 1842, his
friends and admirers were thrown into unexpected grief by hearing that
he had died that morning, after what was termed a four days’ illness.
The immediate cause was said to have been some disorder affecting the
throat, and his sufferings have been described by an intimate friend
and schoolfellow, who was with him at the time, as very painful. The
loss to Spain and the whole literary world was as great as it was
irreparable; and so the people seemed to feel it, by the general
expression of regret over his fate, such as it seldom falls to the lot
of any one to excite.

The moralist might dilate on the evil courses which probably hastened
his death, and all must lament that a man of such extraordinary genius
should have sunk under them; but before we judge any one severely, we
should be certain of being able to form a right judgement. The utmost
remark, therefore, we permit ourselves to make, may be to consider his
history as a lesson to all under similar circumstances of life, that if
they will not take heed to a moral in others, they may become a warning
themselves. Every man’s character may be taken as a whole, in which his
good and evil qualities are often so blended together as to make them
inseparable. The excesses of youth are often “the flash and outbreak
of a fiery mind,” which shows itself in its true characters in other
respects, though often with the alloy of lower passions to lead them
to a fatal end. Thus Byron and Espronceda, two kindred geniuses in our
days, have sunk prematurely into the grave, most unhappily, when new
fields of glory seemed to be opened before them to retrieve the past
errors of life, and make it in future as honourable as they had already
rendered it renowned.

The genius of Espronceda was kindred to Byron’s, of whom he has been
accused of having been an imitator. But this seems to me unquestionably
a mistake. During his residence in England he had certainly acquired
a good knowledge of the English language and literature, much to his
advantage; but he could scarcely have acquired such a knowledge of
either as to put him in the position of an imitator. The utmost that
can be alleged of him in this respect is, that the style of Byron’s
writing was so congenial to his own taste and talent, as to make him
imbibe it intuitively, and so obtain a more decided character for his
own than perhaps it would have otherwise attained.

It is certain that Spanish poetry never before presented such depth
of thought and feeling, and such fulness and vigour of expression, as
he gave to it; and it is apparent, in every page of his works, that
he had studied in a higher school and become imbued with a brighter
inspiration than he could have done on the Continent. But what ordinary
imitators would have considered the characteristics of Byron as models
to follow, he had the good sense entirely to discard. He has none of
the egotism and affectation which distinguish that school; and if he
indulged in some of its propensities, it is clear that they were the
natural results of the circumstances in which he was placed, and not
the wilful perversions of misdirected abilities. His poem to Harifa is
written with an earnestness of feeling that must be felt, even through
the haze of translation, giving tokens of its origin too distinct to
admit any supposition of its being a suggestion from any other source
than his own experience of life. Neither in this poem nor in any
other of his works is there any of those mysterious suggestions of
dark histories, or of those morbid denunciations of imaginary wrongs
which abound in the productions of the Byronian school. His complaints
are the evident effusions of a mind maddened at finding itself in a
state unworthy of its powers, and thus, instead of venting his rage
on others, he turned it against his own misdeeds, in giving way to
excesses that he scorned, and which he felt degraded him. But even in
his aspirations for higher thoughts, he had the same leaven of earth
to keep him from attaining them. He had not learned the lessons which
Jovellanos inculcated in the Epistle to Bermudez, to seek wisdom where
only it ought to be sought; as he might have done even from the heathen
poet, that the hidden things of God could not be found out, though he
were to traverse over all space in search of them.

    Ἀλλ’ οὐ γὰρ ἆν τὰ θεία, κρύπτοντος Θεοῦ,
    Μάθεις ἆν, οὐδ’ εἰ πάντ’ ἐπεξελθοις σκότων.

In somewhat of the same strain with these lines is the second canto of
his poem, the ‘Diablo Mundo,’ addressed to Theresa, which, however, has
no connexion with the rest of the poem to which it is attached. The
verses ‘To a Star,’ contain also poetical thoughts no less exquisite,
though perhaps not of so decided a character; and they are all valuable
at least in this, that instead of gilding over vices and follies,
they show the confession of one so highly gifted by nature, that the
indulgences of sensual gratifications are in reality only sources of
unhappiness.

Two other of his poems, ‘The Mendicant’ and ‘The Executioner,’ are
no less distinguishable for the power of thought and expression they
display; but they also unfortunately indicate such objectionable
tendencies, as to make us regret that his extraordinary talents had
not been directed to nobler subjects. Not so the two poems selected
for translation, ‘The Song of the Pirate,’ and that of the ‘Criminal
Condemned to Die,’ in addition to those previously mentioned. Of these,
the latter is one of such peculiarly energetic character, as to need
no comment. The other is one of the most favourite poems known in
Spain, and having been set to music, is therefore heard repeated more
frequently. It has been said to have been taken from the French, but
I believe erroneously. It bears strongly the impress of Espronceda’s
genius; and if the poem intended be either of those by Floran or Victor
Hugo, any one who will take the trouble of comparing them will observe
that they are essentially different, as each also is from the song of
Lord Byron’s ‘Corsair.’

At the first view of it, the ‘Diablo Mundo’ appears to be an imitation
of ‘Don Juan;’ but it would be as unjust to declare it so, as to say
the latter had been copied from the various Italian poems written in
the same style. Espronceda might have had the idea suggested by reading
Lord Byron’s poem, or Goëthe’s ‘Faust,’ or both, but he has carried it
much higher, and given the outlines of a nobler conception than either.
He begins by supposing that, absorbed in meditation, during the silence
of the night, he hears an extraordinary noise, which calls back his
feelings and arouses them. That confused noise, with sublime music and
solemn sound, are all the passions of the world, all the interests
found in life,--the affections and hatreds, love, glory, wealth, the
vices and the virtues; they are, in fine, the complaint of the whole
universe that comes like a revolving whirlwind, and displays before the
fancy a thousand allegorical monsters, traced with inimitable facility
and astonishing vigour.

The visions pass away, the noise goes gradually off, losing itself in
the distance, until it ceases, where begins the introduction of the
poem. The first canto is the exposition of the great drama proposed to
be developed.

A man bowed down with age and embittered by sorrowful and useless
experience, shuts in despair a book he was reading, and mournfully
convinced of the barrenness of learning, falls asleep. Death then
presents itself, and intones a hymn inviting him to the peace of the
grave. With pleasure he feels his benumbed limbs growing stiff with
cold, and is enjoying himself in the enervation of his spirit, when
Immortality suddenly rises up before him and sings another hymn in
opposition to that of Death, and like that also offering herself to the
man about to die.

The election is immediate; he chooses Immortality, and is re-endowed
with youth. The song of this deity, however, does not lead to the
immortality of the spirit, but of the material part of man, and it
is that he receives. The image of death is invested with melancholy
beauty; it is soft and gentle; that which is desired when, free from
prejudices, we feel the heart worn and the soul discontented. The
immortality that rises over the pale front of death, effaces it with
a magnificent lustre. “It is impossible,” says Ros de Olano, who has
written the prologue to this beautiful poem, “to approach, by any words
of ours whatever, to the luxuriousness of thought, of expression, and
of knowledge displayed in this sublime description, the most happy
perhaps yet presented in the Spanish language.” Grand, extended and
immense is the field which the poet has displayed to trace out a course
for his hero, and the variety of tones he employs are like the face of
the world, over which he has to range. As the character is developed,
the hero, with the body of a man and the soul of a child, is placed in
situations equally original and interesting, and the whole scheme is
one which gave full scope to the writer for an unlimited work, even if
he had been permitted to live to the utmost period of human existence.

Del Rio states, that Espronceda was in his public discourses an
ineffective speaker, and ascribes it to the physical weakness of his
frame; he describes him as having been distinguished for sarcasms,
and only at intervals powerful in declamation. “In conversation he
made an affectation of laughing at the restraints and virtues which
are necessary for the order of society, and yet in private life no
one was more remarkable for kindness and generosity. When the cholera
was raging in Madrid, he was one of the most active in disregarding
its attacks, and in attending to the wants of those near him who were
suffering from it.” “All who knew him loved him, and even to his
faults he knew how to give a certain impression of greatness.” Del
Rio proceeds to describe him as having been graceful in his bearing,
endowed with manly beauty, and his countenance marked with a melancholy
cast that rendered it more interesting. He concludes by observing,
that notwithstanding the years that have passed since his friends had
to lament his loss, a garland of everlastings never fails to be found
renewed over his grave.

In 1848 Baudry published another edition of Espronceda’s works, at
Paris, but, with the exception of the fifth and sixth cantos of the
‘Diablo Mundo,’ there is no additional poem given, though Del Rio
points out six other pieces published in different periodicals. This
omission is much to be regretted, as undoubtedly every line that
proceeded from his pen was worthy of being gathered together as a rare
treasure. It is to be hoped that some admirer of his genius may soon
collect those scattered relics, and give them in an edition worthy of
their character in Spanish literature. Another Life of him also would
be most desirable, as in the Paris edition there is only repeated
the account given by Ferrer del Rio, which, though ably written as a
sketch, is still on the same scale with a number of other writers in
the same work of far inferior merits, and utterly unworthy of so great
a genius as Espronceda. Spanish versification under his influence has
become “revolutionized.” He has extended the powers apparently even of
the language itself, and by the force of his style as well as by the
varied character of his poems, has certainly shown its capabilities
more decidedly than any poet who preceded him.


JOSÈ DE ESPRONCEDA.


TO SPAIN, AN ELEGY. LONDON, 1829.

    How solitary is the nation now
      That peopled countries vast a former day!
    That all beneath her sovereignty to bow,
      From East to West extended once her sway!

    Tears now profuse to shed, unhappy one,
      Queen of the world! ’tis thine; and from thy face,
    Enchanting yet in sorrow, there is none
      Its overwhelming traces to erase.

    How fatally o’er thee has death pour’d forth
      Darkness and mourning, horrible and great!
    And the stern despot in his madden’d wrath
      Exulted wildly o’er thy low estate.

    Nothing or great or beautiful he spared,
      My country! the young warrior by him fell,
    The veteran fell, and vile his war-axe glared,
      Pleased all its fury o’er thee to impel.

    Ev’n the pure maiden fell beneath the rage
      Of the unpitying despot, as the rose
    Condemn’d the summer’s burning sun to engage
      Her bloom and beauty withering soon must close.

    Come, O! ye inhabiters of the earth,
      And contemplate my misery! can there,
    Tell me, be any found of mortal birth
      Bearing the sorrows I am doom’d to bear?

    I wretched, banish’d from my native land,
      Behold, far from the country I adore,
    Her former glories lost and high command,
      And only left her sufferings to deplore.

    Her children have been fatally betray’d
      By treacherous brethren, and a tyrant’s power;
    And these her lovely fertile plains have made
      Fields o’er which lamentations only lower.

    Her arms extended wide unhappy Spain,
      Her sons imploring in her deep distress:
    Her sons they were, but her command was vain,
      Unheard the traitor madness to repress.

    Whate’er could then avail thee, tower or wall,
      My country! still amid thy woes adored?
    Where were the heroes that could once appal
      The fiercest foe? where thy unconquer’d sword?

    Alas! now on thy children’s humbled brow
      Deeply is shame engraved, and on their eyes,
    Cast down and sorrowfully beating now,
      The tears alone of grief and mourning rise.

    Once was a time for Spain, when she possess’d
      A hundred heroes in her hour of pride;
    And trembling nations saw her manifest
      Her power and beauty, dazzling by their side.

    As lofty shows itself in Lebanon
      The cedar, so her brow she raised on high;
    And fell her voice the nations round upon,
      As terrifies a girl the thunders nigh.

    But as a stone now in the desert’s wild
      Thou liest abandon’d, and an unknown way
    Through strangers’ lands, uncertain where, exiled
      The patriot’s doom’d unfortunate to stray.

    Her ancient pomp and power are cover’d o’er
      With sand and weeds contemptuous; and the foe,
    That trembled at her puissance before,
      Now mocks exulting and enjoys her woe.

    Maidens! your flowing locks dishevell’d tear,
      To give them to the wandering winds; and bring
    Your harps in mournful company to share
      With me the sorrowful laments I sing.

    Thus banish’d from our homes afar away
      Still let us weep our miseries. O! Spain,
    Who shall have power thy torments to allay?
      Who shall have power to dry thy tears again!


THE CONDEMNED TO DIE.

    I.

    His form upon the ground reclined,
      With bitter anguish inward drawn,
    Full of the coming day his mind,
      That soon will sadly dawn,
    The culprit waits, in silence laid,
      The fatal moments hastening now,
    In which his last sun’s light display’d
      Will shine upon his brow.

    O’er crucifix and altar there,
      The chapel cell in mourning hung,
    From the dim candle’s yellow glare
      A funeral light is flung;
    And by the wretched culprit’s side,
      His face with hood half cover’d o’er,
    The friar, with trembling voice to guide,
      Is heard his prayers implore.

    His brow then raises he again,
      And slowly lifts to heaven his eyes;
    Perhaps a prayer for mercy fain
      May in his grief arise.
    A tear flows: whence had that release?
      Was it from bitterness or fear?
    Perhaps his sorrows to increase
      Some thought to memory dear?

    So young! and life, that he had dream’d
      Was full of golden days to glide,
    Is pass’d, when childhood’s tears it seem’d
      As scarcely yet were dried.
    Then on him of his childhood burst
      The thought, and of his mother’s woe,
    That he whom she so fondly nursed
      Was doom’d that death to know.

    And while that hopelessly he sees
      His course already death arrest,
    He feels his life’s best energies
      Beat strongly in his breast;
    And sees that friar, who calmly now
      Is laid, with sleep no more to strive,
    With age so feebly doom’d to bow,
      Tomorrow will survive.

    But hark! what noise the silence breaks
      This hour unseasonably by?
    Some one a gay guitar awakes
      And mirthful songs reply;
    And shouts are raised, and sounds are heard
      Of bottles rattling, and perchance
    Others, remember’d well, concurr’d
      Of lovers in the dance.
    And then he hears funereal roll,
      Between each pause in accents high,
    “Your alms, for prayers to rest the soul
      Of him condemn’d to die.”

    And so combined the drunkard’s shout,
      The toast, the strifes, and fancies wild
    Of all that Bacchanalian rout,
      With wanton’s songs defiled,
    And bursts of idle laughter, reach
      Distinct into the gloomy cell,
    And seem far off ejected each
      The very sounds of hell.
    And then he hears, funereal roll
      Between each pause, those accents high,
    “Your alms, for prayers to rest the soul
      Of him condemn’d to die.”

    He cursed them all, as one by one
      The impious echos each express’d;
    He cursed the mother as a son
      Who nursed him at her breast:
    The whole world round alike he cursed,
      His evil destiny forlorn,
    And the dark day and hour when first
      That wretched he was born.

    II.

    The moon serene illumes the skies,
    And earth in deepest stillness lies;
    No sound is heard, the watchdog’s mute,
    And ev’n the lover’s plaintive lute.

    Madrid enveloped lies in sleep;
      Repose o’er all its shade has cast,
    And men of him no memory keep
      Who soon will breathe his last.

    Or if perchance one thinks to wake
      At early dawn, no thoughts whate’er
    Rise for the wretched being’s sake,
      Who death is waiting there.
    Unmoved by pity’s kind control,
      Men hear around the funeral cry,
    “Your alms, for prayers to rest the soul
      Of him condemn’d to die.”

    Sleeps in his bed the judge in peace;
      And sleeps and dreams of how his store,
    The executioner, to increase;
      And pleased he counts it o’er.
    Only the city’s silence breaks,
      And destined place of death portrays,
    The harden’d workman who awakes
      The scaffolding to raise.

    III.

    Confused and mad his heated mind,
      With raving feverish dreams combined,
    The culprit’s soul exhaustion press’d,
      His head sunk heavy on his breast.
    And in his dreams he life and death
      Confounds, remembers, and forgets;
    And fearful struggling every breath,
      And sigh he gives besets.

    And in a world of darkness seems
      As now to stray; feels fear and cold,
    And in his horrid madness deems
      The cord his neck infold:
    And so much more, in desperate fight,
      In anguish to escape his lot,
    He strives, with so much more the might
      He binds the fatal knot:
    And voices hears, confused the whole,
      Of people round, and then that cry,
    “Your alms, for prayers to rest the soul
      Of him condemn’d to die!”

    Or fancies now that he is free;
      And breathes the fresh pure air, and hears
    Her sigh of love, the maid whom he
      Had loved in happier years:
    Beauteous and kind as e’er of old,
      Sweet flower of spring-time’s gay resort,
    As could for love the meads behold,
      Or gallant April court.

    And joyful he to see her flies,
      And seeks to reach her, but in vain;
    For as with anxious hands he tries
      His hoped-for bliss to gain,
    The illusion suddenly to break,
      He finds the dream deceitful fled!
    A cold stiff corpse the shape to take,
      And scaffold in its stead.
    And hears the mournful funeral knoll,
      And hollow voice resounding nigh,
    “Your alms, for prayers to rest the soul
      Of him condemn’d to die!”


THE SONG OF THE PIRATE.

    The breeze fair aft, all sails on high,
      Ten guns on each side mounted seen,
    She does not cut the sea, but fly,
      A swiftly sailing brigantine;
    A pirate bark, the ‘Dreaded’ named,
    For her surpassing boldness famed,
    On every sea well known and shore,
    From side to side their boundaries o’er.

    The moon in streaks the waves illumes;
      Hoarse groans the wind the rigging through;
    In gentle motion raised assumes
      The sea a silvery shade with blue;
    While singing gaily on the poop,
    The pirate Captain, in a group,
    Sees Europe here, there Asia lies,
    And Stamboul in the front arise.

    Sail on, my swift one! nothing fear;
      Nor calm, nor storm, nor foeman’s force
    Shall make thee yield in thy career,
      Or turn thee from thy course.
    Despite the English cruisers fleet
      We have full twenty prizes made;
    And see their flags beneath my feet
      A hundred nations laid.
    My treasure is my gallant bark,
      My only god is liberty;
    My law is might, the wind my mark,
      My country is the sea.

    There blindly kings fierce wars maintain,
      For palms of land, when here I hold
    As mine, whose power no laws restrain,
      Whate’er the seas infold.
    Nor is there shore around whate’er,
      Or banner proud, but of my might
    Is taught the valorous proofs to bear,
      And made to feel my right.
    My treasure is my gallant bark,
      My only god is liberty;
    My law is might, the wind my mark,
      My country is the sea.

    Look when a ship our signals ring,
      Full sail to fly how quick she’s veer’d!
    For of the sea I am the king,
      My fury’s to be fear’d;
    But equally with all I share
      Whate’er the wealth we take supplies;
    I only seek the matchless fair
      My portion of the prize.
    My treasure is my gallant bark,
      My only god is liberty;
    My law is might, the wind my mark,
      My country is the sea.

    I am condemn’d to die! I laugh;
      For, if my fates are kindly sped,
    My doomer from his own ship’s staff
      Perhaps I’ll hang instead.
    And if I fall, why what is life?
      For lost I gave it then as due,
    When from slavery’s yoke in strife
      A rover I withdrew.
    My treasure is my gallant bark,
      My only god is liberty;
    My law is might, the wind my mark,
      My country is the sea.

    My music is the north wind’s roar,
      The noise when round the cable runs,
    The bellowings of the Black Sea’s shore,
      And rolling of my guns.
    And as the thunders loudly sound,
      And furious as the tempests rave,
    I calmly rest in sleep profound,
      So rock’d upon the wave.
    My treasure is my gallant bark,
      My only god is liberty;
    My law is might, the wind my mark,
      My country is the sea.


TO HARIFA, IN AN ORGY.

    Thy hand, Harifa! bring it me;
      Come near, and place it on my brow;
    As on some lava’s boiling sea
      I feel my head is burning now.
    Come, bring with mine thy lips to meet,
      Though they but madden me astray,
    Where yet I find the kisses beat,
      There left thy loves of yesterday.

    What is virtue, what is joy,
      Or love, or purity, or truth?
    The false illusions of a boy,
      The cherish’d flatteries of my youth.
    Then bring me wine; there let me try
      Remembrance drown’d to hold repress’d,
    Without a pang from life to fly;
      In frenzy death may give me rest.

    O’erspreads my face a burning flood,
      And red and glaring wildly start
    My eyes forth out in heated blood,
      And forth leaps restlessly my heart.
    Woman! I hate thee; fly thee--go:
      I feel thy hands my hands infold,
    And feel them freezing, cold as snow,
      As snow thy kisses are as cold.

    Ever the same, try, tempters weak!
      Other endearments to enthral;
    Another world, new pleasures seek,
      For such your joys I curse them all.
    Your kisses are a lie; a cheat
      Is all the tenderness you feign;
    Your beauty ugly in deceit,
      The enjoyment suffering and pain.

    I wish for love, ethereal, high,
      For some diviner joy my lot;
    For such my heart will imaged sigh,
      For such as in the world is not.
    And ’tis that meteor light afar,
      The phantom that deceived my mind,
    The treacherous guide, the vapour star,
      That leads me wandering and blind.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Why is my soul for pleasure dead,
      And yet alive to grief and care?
    Why doom’d in listless stupor laid
      This arid loathing still to bear?
    Why this consuming wild desire,
      This restless passion vague and strange?
    That well I know I rave, ’tis fire,
      Yet plunge in its deceitful range.

    Why do I dream of love and joy,
      That I am sure a lie will prove?
    Why where fantastic charms decoy,
      Will thus my heart delirious move,
    If soon it finds for meads and flowers,
      But arid wastes and tangled thorns,
    And soon a loathing rage o’erpowers
      The mad or mournful love it scorns?

    Flung as a rapid comet wide,
      On ardent fancy’s wings I flew,
    Where’er my wayward mind espied
      Or joys or triumphs to pursue.
    I launch’d myself, in daring flight,
      Beyond the world through heavenward space,
    And found but doubt, and all so bright
      That seem’d, illusive proved the chase.

    Then on the earth I anxious sought
      For virtue, glory, love sublime;
    And my worn spirit found there nought
      But fetid dust and loathsome slime.
    Mid clouds with heavenly hues o’ercast
      Women of virgin lustre shone;
    I saw, I touched them, and they pass’d,
      And smoke and ashes left alone.

    I found the illusion fled; but rife,
      Unquench’d desires their longings crave;
    I felt the real, I hated life,
      And peace believed but in the grave.
    And yet I seek, and anxious seek,
      For pleasures still I ask and sigh,
    And hear dread accents answering speak,
      “Unhappy one! despair, and die.

    “Die: Life is torment, joy a cheat,
      Hope not for good on earth for thee,
    But fruitless struggles look to meet
      In thy vain longings endlessly!
    For so God punishes the soul
      That in its madness dares espy
    The unfathom’d secrets of the scroll
      Of truth, denied to mortal eye!”

           *       *       *       *       *

    O! cease: no more I ask to know,
      No more to see: my soul oppress’d
    Is humbly bow’d, and prostrate low,
      Now only asks, and longs for rest.
    In me let feeling then lie dead,
      Since died my hopes of happiness,
    Nor joys nor griefs be o’er me spread
      My soul returning to depress.

    Pass, as in magic optic glass,
      And other youthful hearts deceive,
    Bright images of glory! pass,
      That crowns of gold and laurel weave.
    Pass, ye voluptuous fair ones, on!
      With dance and mirthful songs attuned,
    Like vaporous visions, pass, begone!
      No more my heart to move or wound.
    And let the dance, and festal din,
      O’er my revolted fancy reign,
    And fled the night, see morn begin,
      Surprised in senseless stupor’s chain.

    Harifa, come! Like me this woe
      Thou too hast borne! Thou ne’er dost weep!
    But, ah! how wretched ’tis to know
      Feelings so bitter and so deep!
    The same our sufferings and care;
      In vain thou hold’st thy tears apart;
    Like me thou also hast to bear
      A wounded and an aching heart!
