Huge are the canna in the dreams of 
X, the mighty thought, the mighty man. 

They fill the terrace of his capitol . 

His thought sleeps not. Yet thought that wakes 
In sleep may never meet another thought 
Or thing . . . Now day-break comes . . . 

X promenades the dewy stones. 

Observes the canna with a clinging eye. 

Observes and then continues to observe.

The soul, he said, is composed 
Of the external world. 



There are men of the East, he said. 
Who are the East. 

There are men of a province 
Who are that province . 

There are men of a valley 
Who are that valley. 



There are men whose words 
Are as natural sounds 
Of their places 
As the cackle of toucans 
In the place of toucans. 

The mandoline is the instrument 
Of a place . 



Are there mandolines of Western mountains? 
Are there mandolines of Northern moonlight? 



The dress of a woman of Lhassa, 

In its place. 

Is an invisible element of that place 
Made visible.

I placed a jar in Tennessee, 

And round it was, upon a hill. 

It made the slovenly wilderness 
Surround that hill. 

The wilderness rose up to it. 

And sprawled around, no longer wild. 
The jar was round upon the ground 
And tall and of a port in air. 

It took dominion everywhere. 

The jar was gray and bare. 

It did not give of bird or bush. 

Like nothing else in Tennessee.

Pour the unhappiness out 
From your too bitter heart. 

Which grieving will not sweeten. 

Poison grows in this dark. 

It is in the water of tears 
Its black blooms rise. 

The magnificent cause of being-- 
The imagination, the one reality 
In this imagined world-- 

Leaves you 

With him for whom no phantasy moves. 
And you are pierced by a death.
